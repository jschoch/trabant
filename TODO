rip out digraph and mdgraph, to much hacking needed to get working with updates and vertex ids

should be able to have a default graph everywhere

outE(g,atom_label) is driving me nutz, do I really need this?  There seems no way to query for item metadata like has_attribute_key?


lots of hack accumulating, look at TODOs
